'''
We need to figure out how to sort arrays
        DEFAULT: ASCENDING ORDER

unsorted = [9,2,5,7,3,1]


Bubble sort will compare element i with element i+1
    Sort if the element is out of place

    
ONE ITERATION OVER THE ARRAY fixes the position of ONE element
    [10, 8, 2]
        Intermediary step: [8, 10, 2]
    [8, 2, 10]

In the first iteration, max total comparisons are going to be (length-1)
Then we continue decreasing them by one as elements continue getting fixed


1. Iterate over the array   -> LOOPS (FOR LOOPS)
2. Iterate over the array again and again   -> LOOPS 
    NESTED LOOPS

OUTER: Iterate over the array again and again. FIx all elements
{
    INNER: Iterate over the array, fixing one element at a time
}
